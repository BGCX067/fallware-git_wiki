#summary Moved the source repo from Subversion to git.

= Introduction =

I'm a believer in git so the source repository has been moved there.  Used the instructions at ConvertingSvnToGit on the Google code support wiki.

= Details =

Did a top-skim import.  The svn repo was fairly new and little-changed since inception, so there was no point in importing full history.
